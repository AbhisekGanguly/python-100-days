@topic: print function in python and how to use it. 
'''

#a print function in python looks like the following.
print()

#within the parenthesis, you can add things you want to print out.
print(1)

#if it's a number, you can write it out as it is, if not, then you have to write in in quotes.
print("Hello world!")
print('Hello world!')
#double and single quotes works the same way

#if you want to print in multiple lines, you can also use triple quotes
print('''hello
this is printed
in multiple
lines!''')
