'''

#In python, you can also ask for inputs from users using input function
input()

#To specify to your user, what input you want, you can also write statements within the function like in print
input("Enter you Name: ")
#The input's statements follows the print statement syntax! so less work for us.

#After inputing the data, the user have to press enter on the keyboard for the data to be accepted by the machine
